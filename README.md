TestNG Framework Development for Automation Testing of ACTI-TIME Application

I have developed a TestNG framework for automation testing of the Trello application. This framework incorporates the TestNG testing framework, allowing for efficient and structured test case execution. It aims to ensure the reliability and quality of the Trello application by automating various functional and integration tests.


   As a part of Training Course in Q Spiders we undertook this mini project. ACTI-TIME is web-based software for time tracking and management. It helps improve business process, analyze team performance and reduce costs. It is a unique application that enables the organization manages performance and generates precise reports regarding employee shifts and performance with the help of its enhanced tools.
